Week 1

2017 Point-by-Point data:
make player column         
## done 

2017 point-by-point importance data.
do players handle important points differently? If so, why? Serve speed, return speed? 
## points in importance vs Speed_MPH dont appear to have a pattern
## looked at big 3 specifically and all players

match data (could do non-GS and the GS). ## made separate df for each
make player column ## done 
make plot for a particular player ## made plot for all players and plot for Roger, Rafa

Keep track missing values, and see if you can figure out where they come from.
Figure out what each relevant variable means and is recording.


Mixed Effects Models (thinking about serving player as one random effect and
returning player as another random effect)

get rid of speed_mph after replacing 0's with na
# need help here

look for NA's in speed_mph
# No NA's in Speed_MPH

I think some of the importance values are missing because they involve a 5th set that went to 8-6, 9-7, etc. The original importance data set didn't have importance values for these....they need to be manually created. A point at 0-0 at 5-5 in the 5th set should have the same importance as a point at 0-0 at 6-6 in the 5th set, etc. 
This will be a little tricky because (1) need to split by men and women first since women need the same thing done but for the 3rd set and (2) need to be careful not to do this for the U.S. Open (the only slam that has a 5th set / 3rd set tiebreak). 

Make introductory presentation. See folder with presentations: there is also one from Tom Zhang on Sakai: Summer Research.
