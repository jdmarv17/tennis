Week 1

2017 Point-by-Point data:
make player column

2017 point-by-point importance data.
do players handle important points differently? If so, why? Serve speed, return speed? 
## points in importance vs Speed_MPH dont appear to have a pattern
## looked at big 3 specifically and all players

match data (could do non-GS and the GS). ## made separate df for each
make player column ## done 
make plot for a particular player ## made plot for all players and plot for Roger, Rafa

Keep track missing values, and see if you can figure out where they come from.
Figure out what each relevant variable means and is recording.
