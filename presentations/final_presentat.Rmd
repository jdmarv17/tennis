## Introduction

* Purpose: An attempt to characterize the importance of the serve for specific players in professional tennis and predict the serve based on point importance
* Motivation: It seems like there is a lack of valuable comments on the serve in professional tennis
* The data used includes match level and point level data (from https://github.com/JeffSackmann)
    + Also used point importance data (from Stephanie Kovalchik's "deuce" R package)

## Model Building

* Bradley-Terry Model (match data)
    + A paired competetion model based on "ability" that returns predicted match win probability
* Mixed effects model (point data)
    + This model showed that while point importance is significant, its role is too small to influence serve prediction
* Neuralnet (point data)
    + Used player indicators, side of the court, whether the server was leading in the game, and several other indicators as predictors for the categorical response serve location

## Neural Net

* The neural net performed about 5% better than basic proportion model (45-47% compared to 50-52% successful)

```{r, out.width = "700px"}
knitr::include_graphics("NNplot.png")
```


## App

* Built with Shiny in R
* App lets user select player of interest and any number of opponents and plots predicted match win probability with predictor first serve percentage
* Most players have positive relationships between first serve percentage and predicted match win probability
    + Surprisingly some have negative relationships
    + We suspect this may be due to different serve strategies' success

## Next steps

* Neural net
* explaining downward trend
* new variables for BT
