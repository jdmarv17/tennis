```{r}
# gs_matches_long has duplicate matches
# only want the matches where the winner_name or loser_name for big 3 matches the 
# win indicator variable
big3<- 
  gs_matches_long %>%
  filter((winner_name == "Roger Federer" & win == 1) | (loser_name == "Roger Federer" & win == 0) | (winner_name == "Rafael Nadal" & win == 1) | (loser_name == "Rafael Nadal" & win == 0) | (winner_name == "Novak Djokovic" & win == 1) | (loser_name == "Novak Djokovic" & win == 0)) %>%
  mutate(big3_name = case_when(
    winner_name == "Roger Federer" | loser_name == "Roger Federer" ~ "Roger Federer",
    winner_name == "Rafael Nadal" | loser_name == "Rafael Nadal" ~ "Rafael Nadal",
    winner_name == "Novak Djokovic" | loser_name == "Novak Djokovic" ~ "Novak Djokovic"
  ))

ggplot(big3, aes(win, serve_percentage, color = big3_name)) +
  stat_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = c("binomial"))
```

when pivoting to long format, could try to create a variable called player name so that....

```{r}
test_df <- data.frame(matchid = c(1, 2), winningplayer = c("Nadal", "Djokovic"),
  losingplayer = c("Thiem", "Nadal"), w_serveperc = c(90, 80), l_serveperc = c(50, 60))
test_df
```

becomes....

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
long_df <- test_df %>% pivot_longer(c(winningplayer, losingplayer), 
  names_to = "winorlose", values_to = "player")
```

You could end up just stacking two data frames: one for the winning player and one for the losing player. This takes a little bit of work but it's the easiest way I could think of to figure out how to get the desired output.

```{r}
loser_stats <- long_df %>% select(-starts_with("w_")) %>% 
  filter(winorlose == "losingplayer")
names(loser_stats) <- c("matchid", "serveperc", "winorlose", "player")
winner_stats <- long_df %>% select(-starts_with("l_")) %>%
  filter(winorlose == "winningplayer")
names(winner_stats) <- c("matchid", "serveperc", "winorlose", "player")

df <- bind_rows(loser_stats, winner_stats)

## then filter by big3 (or whatever) and plot. There will be one observation
## per match if the member of the big 3 played someone else and two
## observations if members of the big 3 played each other but the plot should
## work out, colouring by player.
```
